"topp\n\\( Q \\)\nthe atoms are almost lacking in mobility, their kinetic energy is negligibly small. It is this lack of mobility which makes a solid rigid. This rigidity is the cause of elasticity in solids. In some solids such as steel, the atoms are bound together by larger nter-atomic forces than in solids such as aluminum. Thus, the elastic behavio\nvaries from solid to solid. Even fluids\nexhibit elasticity. All material bodies get deformed when subjected to a suitable force. The ability of a body to regain its original shape and size is called elasticity. The deforming force per unit area is called stress. The\nchange in the dimension (length, shape or volume) divided by the original dimension is called strain. The three kinds of stress are tensile stress\nshearing stress, and volumetric stress. The corresponding strains are called tensile strain, shearing strain and volume strain. According to Hooke's law, within the elastic limit, stress is proportional to strain. The ratio stress/strain is called the modulus of\nelasticity. The figure shows the strain-stress graphs for materials A and B.
